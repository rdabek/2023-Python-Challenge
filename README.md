# Python challenge

## About this repository

This repository is a python challenge repository.

## Run the code

In order to run the programs I recommend to use vscode. You should also have a python environment installed on your machine.

The launch config should be usable on both windows and linux. Only thing you have to do is to open the `__init__.py` file of each exercise and press `F5` (in vscode).
